## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

In this puzzle game, there will be shapes falling from the top of the world. The shapes are formed using multiple small square blocks and the shapes are of different forms. The player has to strategically place those falling shapes on the ground in the goal to make a connecting line of small square blocks. Once a line is formed, that line gets removed and the blocks on top of that line falls down. Points are awarded for each line formed. Once a certain amount of points are reached, the level is increased. Higher the level, faster the shapes will fall giving less time for the player to think and act. Once the placed shapes build a tower exceeding top of the world (line where shapes start to fall), the game ends and the score is shown to the player. If the score is among the top five highscores, the player is asked for his nickname and his score gets placed in the highscore leaderboard.
